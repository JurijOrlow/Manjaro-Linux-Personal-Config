# Manjaro-Linux-Personal-Config
This is repo, that contains all files, and scripts needed to perform a semi-full customization of Manjaro Linux

Only thing you need to have installed on your system is git to clone this repository. Everything else is downloaded and installed automatically.

First you need to change directory to Manjaro-Linux-Personal-Config, and run setup.sh.
After installation you will be prompted to reboot your computer. Do that, and login back, but into i3.
DO NOT autocreate config file (press Esc on pop-up after logging in).
Then run terminal with Alt+Enter, change directory to Manjaro-Linux-Personal-Config, and run i3config.sh.

Enjoy your i3!
